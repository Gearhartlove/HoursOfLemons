# HoursOfLemons

The intention of this project is to create a vertical slice of a RAG based AI Agent that answer's question from a pdf, reinforcing with images.

The subject of this project is 24 Hours of Lemons, described as "An endurance car racing series on dedicated road courses for $500 cars.".

24 Hours of Lemons has many resources on their site, including checkboxes, drop-down lists, and more. For this prototype I'll be tackling a pdf with technical pictures and descriptive instructions.

The PDF in question is: https://24hoursoflemons.com/wp-content/themes/lemons/assets/images/how-to-not-fail-lemons-tech-inspection.pdf

In this prototype, I will create a vertical slice of what an AI Virtual Inspector could be. This inspector will answer one-off inquires related to vehicle technical inspections. Here are some example interactions:

User Question: Do I need to organize my wire's? How do I even do that?
Virtual Inspector: "Appropriate answer with backup supporting images"


Details I need to figure out: 
- How am I going to parse this document?
- How am I going to share images with a user?
- Some of the pictures have this very scrappy and scratchy handwriting, should I incorporate that?
- ... more to come here ...
